# Malaprabha-Priliminary-Experiment-on-rainfall
This project focusses on predicting the future water availability in the dry regions of Karnataka, in view of the expected Drought and Extreme Rainfall in the coming decade, by analysing the Malaprabha Catchment region


METHODOLOGY
1. Observed daily Rainfall data and Hourly Water flow rate for Malaprabha.
2.Carry out Numerical Modeling of the water flow in the Catchment area  using the Basic Equations of Hydrodynamics.
3. Conduct a field trip to measure the water percolation down due to gravity and water Diffusion due to gradient of water saturation of the soil.
